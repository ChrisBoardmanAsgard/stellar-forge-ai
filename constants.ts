Refined Hybrid Plasma-Warp Propulsion (RHPWP): A Positive-Energy Subluminal Pathway to Interstellar Crewed Travel by 2070-2100

Author: Christopher James Boardman
Date: November 2025

Abstract
Interstellar travel demands propulsion systems that overcome relativistic barriers without violating general relativity. This paper refines the Hybrid Plasma-Warp Propulsion (HPWP) concept into a physically compliant, positive-energy subluminal framework (RHPWP). By integrating directed-energy boosts, fusion-powered plasma sheaths (inspired by the Davis Drive and Meyler-Fuchs Hybrid), and constant-velocity warp metrics modeled via Warp Factory, RHPWP achieves effective speeds up to 0.99c using only ordinary matter. Energy requirements are reduced by orders of magnitude compared to original Alcubierre models through toroidal plasma layering and torsion enhancement. For a crewed mission to Proxima Centauri (4.24 ly), Earth elapsed time is ~4.3 years at 0.99c, with ship proper time ~7 months. Feasibility aligns with 2040-2070 advancements in fusion (e.g., Pulsar Fusion Sunbird) and laser arrays. Mathematical derivations, simulations, and a validation roadmap are provided.

Refinement of the Resonant Torsion-Plasma Drive (RTPD)

Author: Christopher James Boardman
Date: May 2024

Abstract
The Resonant Torsion-Plasma Drive (RTPD) refines plasma-based propulsion by integrating torsion physics with resonant frequency amplification, enabling subluminal speeds up to 0.75-0.85c. This paper details a physically compliant model that uses a rotating, layered plasma torus subjected to high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields tuned to the plasma's cyclotron resonance. This resonance amplifies torsion effects within the spacetime metric, creating a localized, forward-propagating gravitational wave that propels the craft without violating conservation of momentum. The system leverages a compact fusion reactor to power both the plasma generation and the EM resonance coils. Key innovations include a feedback control system for maintaining resonance stability and a metamaterial-lined chamber that minimizes energy dissipation. Simulations demonstrate that for a 100-tonne vessel, a mission to Proxima Centauri could be completed with a ship proper time of approximately 3-4 years, offering a viable, near-term alternative to traditional reaction drives for interstellar exploration. Energy requirements are modeled, showing a significant reduction compared to pure warp-field metrics, positioning the RTPD as a pragmatic step toward interstellar travel.
